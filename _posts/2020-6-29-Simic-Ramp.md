By now everyone should now the shell of every UGx ramp deck: Growth Spiral, Uro, Nissa, and Hydroid Krasis. Before M21 it was necessary to add White to heave the deck into the competitive metagame. M21 introduced new cards to Standard that enable Simic Ramp to be relevant again.

What is the benefit of cutting White and relinquishing potent cards like Elspeth Conquers Death, Shatter the Sky and Teferi, Time Raveler? 
- You're maximising Nissa because you are playing more Forests.
- Your mana base improves: You spare your life total by playing less Shocklands. Furthermore it is more consistent because you only need two colors.
- You can play Mass Manipulation to come back against overwhelming decks like Bant Ramp.
- Your deck is more streamlined and consistent in general because you are playing a lot of playsets and cards that are good in a vacuum. Elspeth Conquers Death loses its powers when matched against low to the ground aggro decks, Shatter the Sky loses value when playing against control decks.

But what pushes Simic Ramp into Tier-One? Let's look at the new main-deck cards by ascending CMC order. Mazemind Tome poses as the glue of the deck, it keeps your game-plan churning. The scry  ability smoothes your draws and when you have two mana open, it draws you a card. Solemn Simulacrum does everything you want. First of all it supports your main game-plan which is ramping. It's a decent attacker against slow controlling decks. It's a chump-blocker with an upside. To top it off it doesn't get removed by Ugin's minus ability. Teferi, Master of Time is a Teferi planeswalker that will impact multiple formats once again. It already appeared in a winning deck in a Legacy Challenge on MTGO ([https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/legacy-challenge-2020-06-29](https://magic.wizards.com/en/articles/archive/mtgo-standings/legacy-challenge-2020-06-29)). The plus ability generates card advantage by being able to loot every turn. The minus ability can disabled chump-blockers for a lethal attack. Otherwise it slows down attackers. When you reach the ultimate of Teferi it is usually a game win or at least develops an advantage that can't be overcome. Now to Ugin, the Spirit Dragon - your finisher. You ramp up to eight mana pretty fast and you can find it pretty fast too (thanks to the massive amount of card draw). Once Ugin hits the board it is usually game over. The Spirit Dragon will clear the board except your Solemn Simulacrum and animated Nissa lands which is a neat interaction in the deck. Then Ugin proceeds to shoot down your opponent and the ultimate is a game finisher too. It's the best card you can ramp into.

A few words to the sideboard. The counter-spells are necessary against control and other ramp decks. Scavening Ooze eats up opposing Uros, naturally hoses graveyard strategies and slows down aggro decks. Lovestruck Beast brick-walls aggro decks. Spark Hunter Masticore is an experiment against other Ugin decks and also viable against decks relying on powerful planeswalkers.    Enthralling Hold is an experiment too but is meant for decks using powerful creatures and acts as an expensive but powerful removal spell. Right now I'm not facing Temur Reclamation very often which is why I'm not using Wilt or Shifting Ceratops. If I'm paired against Temur Reclamation I still can fight it with counter-spells and Scavening Ooze. Here's a little trick against control and ramp decks. Sometimes I just boarded in all creatures and transformed my deck into an aggro like deck leaving most of their sideboard cards dead. I would just rush my opponents down with my creatures out of the sideboard.

To complete the article I'll explore more card options:
- Jolrael, Mwonvuli Recluse: It is a nice idea but wasn't that effective when I played it. You have access to a lot of card draw to enable Jolrael but it is sometimes a bit awkward when you have to play Growth Spiral in your turn. The body itself is weak and often it generated just one token which had no impact on the game.
- Scavenging Ooze in the main-deck: I couldn't snack opposing Uros out of the graveyard and it was shut down by the removal of Jund or Rakdos Sacrifice.
- Cultivate: I didn't even try this card. Uro seems like the way better three drop and the ramp suite seems already great enough.

I rushed through Diamond to Mythic without a loss. The performance of the deck in competitive tournaments is hard to predict. The meta is far from constituted and we'll have to see what tournament results will bring. In the meantime I think Simic Ramp is one of the top decks to grind the ladder on Arena.
