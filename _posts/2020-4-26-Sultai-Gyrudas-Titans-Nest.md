title: Sultai Gyruda's Titans' Nest
tags: [Sultai, Midrange, Combo]
---  
- 2 key cards: Gyruda, Doom of Depths, and Titan's Nest
- Companion: Gyruda
- From combo to midrange
- Is Thassa, Deep-Dwelling and Spark Double necessary, or should they yield to more midrange cards (e.g. Casualties of War)
	- Spark Double and Thassa, or just one option?
	- Spark Double loses value when the amount of planeswalkers and creatures declines
- Bonder's Enclave to draw cards when pay-offs hit the field and you manoeuvred into a checkmate situation
- Is cheap and fast removal in form of Heartless Act needed, or is expensive but better removal like Eat to Extinction better?
	- Sadly Murderous Rider can't be played with Gyruda
- Card considerations:
	- Extinction Event
		- One-sided mass removal
	- Fblthp
		- Early card draw, card draw with Gyruda's effect, works fine with Spark Double
	- Lazav
		- Copies creature's milled with Gyruda
	- Food package: Wicked Wolf, Feasting Troll King and Trail of Crumbs
		- Removal and card advantage
		- Another sticky finisher
	- Acolyte of Affliction 
		- Rebuys cards from graveyard
	- Izoni
		- Benefits from creatures in the graveyard
	- Casualties of War
		- Allows to claw back in lost games
		- Lots of targets because a lot of enchantments and planeswalkers are played
- Benefit of Titan's Nest: 
	- No need of manadorks to ramp into Gyruda
	- Card selection
	- Utilising cards milled with Gyruda
- Problems:
	- Balance between creatures and non-creature cards
	- Playing cards from your graveyard
		- Use them as fuel instead
		- Tamiyo, Acolyte of Attrition?
		- Reanimation spells?
	- Milling yourself
		- Thassa's Oracle?
		- Fiend Artisan
			- Finds key creatures from deck
			- Gets buffed by milled creatures
- Sideboard:
	- Leyline and Legion's End against Lurrus decks because Grafdigger's Cage violates the deckbuilding restriction of Gyruda, Doom of Depths
	- Destiny Spinner against counterspells
		- Alternative to try: Negate
	- Aether Gust against red and/or green aggressive decks, Jeskai Control, Fires decks, Temur Reclamation
	- Ashiok's Erasure against decks relying on key cards, e.g. Fires decks, Temur Reclamation
		- Is it really good?
	- Wilt against hate cards like Grafdigger's Cage
		- Also effective against Fires decks, or Temur Reclamation
		- Cycling provides versatility
